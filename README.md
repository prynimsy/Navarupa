# Navarupa - Reviving Style Redefining You

sustainable fashion and decor e-commerce platform that facilitates the collection of old clothing and materials from individuals, NGOs, and factories. These materials are then upcycled into fashion and home decor products in collaboration with NGOs and local artisans — who are fairly compensated for their work. The final products are sold via NavaRupa’s platform.
